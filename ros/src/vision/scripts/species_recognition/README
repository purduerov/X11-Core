Our computer vision systems this year are split across four different programs. First there is the LineFollowing
program and its subfiles. There is also a GridMapping program, a Line Measurement program, and a shape identification
program for species recognition


GridMapping.py: This file tracks the position of the ROV in a grid
LineMeasurement.py: This file determines the lenght of an input line
shapeIdentification.py: This file performs species recognition, differentiating species A->D
line_follow.py: This program calculates the desired control vector for line following.

Helper Files:
find_corners.py: This file is used in line_follow.py
